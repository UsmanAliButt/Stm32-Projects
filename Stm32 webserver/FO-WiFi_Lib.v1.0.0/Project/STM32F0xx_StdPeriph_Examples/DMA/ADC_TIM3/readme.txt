@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use a DMA channel to transfer
continuously a data from a peripheral (ADC1) to another peripheral (TIM3) supporting
DMA transfer.The ADC channel11 is configured to be converted continuously. 
TIM3_CH1 is configured to generate a PWM signal on its output.

The dedicated DMA1 channel3 is configured to transfer in circular mode the last ADC 
channel11 converted value to the TIM3_CCR1 register. The DMA channel request is driven
by the TIM3 update event. The duty cycle of TIM3_CH1 output signal is then changed
each time the input voltage value on ADC channel11 pin is modified.

The duty cycle variation can be visualized on oscilloscope on the TIM3_CH1 pin
PA.06 while changing the analog input on ADC channel11 using the potentiometer.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
     - Use potentiometer RV3
     - Connect TIM3_CH1 pin PA.06 to an oscilloscope to visualize the duty cycle variation 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
