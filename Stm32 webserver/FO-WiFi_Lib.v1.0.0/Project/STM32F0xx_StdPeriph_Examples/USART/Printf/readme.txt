@par Example Description 

This example shows how to retarget the C library printf function to the USART. 
This implementation output the printf message on the Hyperterminal using USART1.

The USARTx is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

  - USART/Printf/stm32f0xx_it.h       Interrupt handlers header file
  - USART/Printf/stm32f0xx_it.c       Interrupt handlers

@note The "system_stm32f0xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to meet user application requirements. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F0xx_Clock_Configuration_VX.Y.Z.xls" 
      provided with the AN4055 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/class/1734.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>

         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx) 
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
      - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
        CN7 and PC serial port.

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 
 
 
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain      
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
