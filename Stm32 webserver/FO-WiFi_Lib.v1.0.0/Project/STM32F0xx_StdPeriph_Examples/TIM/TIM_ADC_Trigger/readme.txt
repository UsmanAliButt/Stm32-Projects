@par Example Description 

This example describes how to configure the TIM to trigger the ADC conversion.

In this example the TIM1 is configured in PWM mode, the TIM1 CC4 event is used
to trigger the ADC.

The ADC is configured to convert continuously the ADC_Channel_11 (connected to
potentiometer RV3 on the EVAL Board).
Each time the TIM1 CC4 event occurs, the ADC convert the variable voltage. 
 
User can display continuously the ADC_Channel_11 voltage on the EVAL Board LCD

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

 - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Use the potentiometer RV3 to change the ADC_Channel_11 voltage.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
