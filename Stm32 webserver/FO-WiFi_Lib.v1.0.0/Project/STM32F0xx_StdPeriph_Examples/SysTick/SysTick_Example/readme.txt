@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the SysTick to generate a time base equal to
1 ms. The system clock is set to 48 MHz, the SysTick is clocked by the AHB clock (HCLK).

A "Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick end-of-count event.
Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx) 
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PC.10, PC.11, PC.12
      and PD.02 pins 

      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
