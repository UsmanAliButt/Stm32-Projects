@par Example Description 

The STM32F0xx microcontroller has an embedded comparator which can be used
in combination with DAC peripheral for more application like the measure of light
intensity (using the LDR sensor).

In this example when the luminosity changes the progress bar displayed on the color
LCD changes according to light intensity level detected on comparator.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that jumper JP13 is not fitted to avoid noise from the speaker.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
