@par Example Description 

This example describes how to measure VBAT voltage using ADC1 regular channel 18.
In fact, the measured value correspond to VBAT/2; as the VBAT voltage could be higher
than VDDA, to ensure the correct operation of the ADC, the VBAT pin is internally
connected to a bridge divider by 2.

User can display the VBAT voltage on the EVAL Board LCD

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that jumper JP12 is in position 2-3 to connect the 3V battery to VBAT pin

     
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
