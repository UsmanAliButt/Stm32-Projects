@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the RTC peripheral’s with 
Alarm sub seconds feature to simulate a timer with refresh time equal to 250 ms
(1 second/ 8) * 2).

The RTC is configured to generate sub seconds interrupt each 125ms (will have
8 interrupt per 1 second).
  
For this example an interactive human interface is developed using LCD and buttons
to allow user to use Timer with a real "sand timer" display.

After startup, the sand timer is equal to 1 Minute (60 Seconds) and by pressing on
the RIGHT button the bottom bulb start to be filled for each 2 successive interrupts (after each 250ms).
After 480 interrupts (60 * 8) the bottom bulb will be full.

User can manipulate the chronometer features using the Joystick LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN buttons:
  - press Joystick RIGHT button to Start the timer.
  - press again Joystick RIGHT button to stop the timer.
  - press Joystick LEFT button to Restart the timer.
  - press Joystick  UP/DOWN button to adjust the timer.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Joystick RIGHT, LEFT, UP and DOWN buttons

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
